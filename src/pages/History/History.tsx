                Founded in a garage with nothing but a dream and a bold recipe, GRIZZ was born from a passion for two things: the great outdoors and great beer. We believed every pint should be an adventure, a taste of the untamed.
              </p>
              <p className={styles.historyText}>
                Our first brew, the 'Grizzly Gold,' quickly became a local legend. We grew from that single garage to a small, dedicated brewhouse, but our philosophy never changed. We use only the finest natural ingredients and a fearless brewing process to create beers with untamed flavor.
              </p>
              <p className={styles.historyText}>
                Today, GRIZZ is more than just a beerâ€”it's a community. We're a team with big ambitions, dedicated to crafting beers that are as bold and authentic as the wilderness that inspires us.
